Proposal:	
1. Creativity, originality 20/20/					Solutions exist however it does not make sense for individuals as they can get expensive when managed
													from a single point of service provider. We look to create an application that can help ease this.
2. Complexity 15/15/								Upfront time was invested to select specific technologies and tools in existence that would ease
													our issues surrounds transcoding algorithms and fluctuating resource management as well as future demand loads
3. Practicality & design 15/15/						Simple and straight forward front-end with integrated and seemless backend
5. Writing of the proposal 10/10/					Provides tools to be used, what is to be done, and why we are doing it
	
Implementation:										See manual.txt file which discusses system functionality and design
1. Requirement satisfactions 50/50/
2. Special features and techniques 50/50/
3. Friendly user interface 25/25/
4. Database design and usage 25/25/
5. Algorithms and data structures 25/25/
6. System design (robust, efficiency) 25/25/
	
Documentation:	
1. Organization	5/5/								Well structured with components broken out into separate headings
2. Clarity 5/5/										Language is unambiguous and to the point
3. Details 5/5/										Goes over motivations, justification to choice of development tools used and external applications integrated
													Elicits how the application works as a whole without going into unnecessary detail of specific code blocks
4. Writing of the documentation	5/5/				Simple, straight forward, tries to keep the reader engaged and ties in business implications where appropriate
